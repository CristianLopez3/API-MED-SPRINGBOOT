# API-Med with Spring Boot

This project is my first REST API developed using Spring Boot. It demonstrates the implementation of various design patterns such as the Data Transfer Object (DTO) and the Factory pattern. The API also incorporates JSON Web Token (JWT) for security purposes and follows best practices for returning responses.

## About

I built this API during the Bootcamp at One Next Education by Oracle and Alura Latam. It serves as an example of my skills in developing robust and secure RESTful services using Spring Boot. The project emphasizes the importance of adhering to industry-standard design patterns and security practices for creating efficient and reliable APIs.

## Features

- Implementation of RESTful endpoints
- Utilization of DTO and Factory design patterns
- Integration of JSON Web Token for enhanced security
- Adherence to best practices for returning responses

## Installation

To run the API, make sure you have Java 17 and Maven installed. You can run the application using the following command:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```
